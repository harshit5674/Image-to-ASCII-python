# Image-to-ASCII-python

In this project i will try to make ascii art using images!!

Currently what i have in mind is a program in which i give a image as input and it gives same image made with ascii charaters.

One might say that there are already tools on the internet for this, so what, i want to make my own so i can create a image for my codeforces profile photo, DAMN it would look cool!!!

How will i do it, Currently i dont know anything, but i am curious and i am sure i will make it before my finals end ;)
